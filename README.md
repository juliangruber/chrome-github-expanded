# chrome-github-expanded

Expand diffs that GitHub mistakenly hides.

This is currently hard wired to expand diffs for files matching `*/node_modules/*`.

## Installation

1) Clone this repository
2) Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
3) Enable `Developer mode`
4) Load this folder via `Load unpacked extension...`

## Known bugs

On pull requests, you need to reload the page after you navigate to the files tab. This will be fixed soon.
